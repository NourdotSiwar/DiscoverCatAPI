## Notes

* Getting started with the project, solved by starting with the UI 
* Getting information of breed from API, solved by adding parameter or has_breed=true
* Struggled with clicking an attribute to add to the ban list, solved by utilizing GitHub CoPilot
* Struggled with changing/editing/modifying query parameter to add and remove breeds in accordance to user, solved by adding a dictionary of breeds.
* Struggled with displaying multiple attributes, as in more than just the breed, such as weight or origin country.
